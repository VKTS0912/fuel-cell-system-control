### Fuel Cell System
Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are the most promising fuel cell technology because of their high-power density, low operating temperature, quick
startup capability, and low weight. Efficient use of the PEMFC requires keeping it working at an adequate power point and protecting fuel cells from damage
problems. Through this project, we learn how to extract the maximum power from the PEMFC system and protect it from membrane damage by stabilizing the hydrogen and oxygen partial
pressure
